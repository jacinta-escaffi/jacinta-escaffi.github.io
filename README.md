# Pdf_reader

I worked with a real estate firm to automate the extraction of tax data from PDFs (since the data wasn't available in Excel format) to streamline their tax payment process.

This used to be a grueling manual task that took an entire week of labor, involving the transfer of hundreds of data points from PDFs to spreadsheets (a process prone to human error in tax calculations). By implementing this automation, I slashed the processing time to just **30 minutes**. This not only improved data accuracy and ensured error-free tax calculations but also freed up the staff to focus on high-value tasks instead of manual data entry.
